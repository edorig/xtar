File Viewer</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The <strong>XTar</strong>
File Viewer, is a built-in browser, for displaying selected files.
Text files are displayed in the main window but external
applications can be launched to handle any file types externally
(such as a GIF viewer). The external file viewers are configured
using <strong>XTar</strong>'s </font><a href="resources.html"><font
color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">resources</font></a><font
color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">.</font></p>

<p><img src="images/viewer.gif"
width="528" height="431"></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The status line at the bottom of
the viewer displays the currently opened file - this is the full
pathname as it appears in the archive. Use the toolbar to
navigate backwards and forwards through any selected files and to
save a copy of the current file locally.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Previous</strong>,
displays the previous document displayed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Next</strong>, displays
the next selected file - the files are displayed in the order
they are stored in the archive.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Launch External...</strong>,
if a file has an association to an external program, then the
command line to launch the program will appear in the main window.
Click this button to run the command.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Save As...</strong>,
allows you to save the file to another location - select the
location in the file dialog box that appears.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Close</strong>, closes the
viewer.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Every time a viewer is launched <strong>XTar</strong>
creates a temporary directory and extracts selected files to that
directory for viewing. You may open as many viewers as you like
but be aware that <strong>XTar</strong> will create a new
directory for each viewer, so watch your disc space usage. When a
file viewer is closed, it's associated temporary directory is
deleted.</font></p>
