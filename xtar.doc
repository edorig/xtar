 NAME
      xtar 1.5b - view contents of a tar file

 SYNOPSIS
      xtar [Xoptions] [tarfile[.gz|.Z]]

 DESCRIPTION
      XTar is a Motif program for viewing and manipulating tar archives
      (which may be compressed).  The contents of the archive are displayed
      in the main window and various options are available from pulldown and
      popup menus.

      The main window shows the name of the file currently displayed.

      The main XTar pulldown menu has the following options:

      OPEN             Open a new tar file.

      CLOSE            Close currently opened tar file.

      VIEW...          View the contents of any selected files, using the
                       internal file viewer or launch an external viewer.

      EXTRACT...       Extract the contents of any selected files to a
                       specified directory.

      EXTRACT ALL...   Extract the contents of the entire tar archive to a
                       specified directory.

      STATISTICS...    View statistics about the currently opened tar
                       archive.

      FILENAME SEARCH...
                       Perform a regular expression search on the FILENAMES
                       in the tar file.  This can also be activated by
                       pressing '/' in the main window.

      NEXT             Search for the next occurence of the regular
                       expression.  This can also be activated by pressing

      CONVERT UID/GID  Convert user IDs and group IDs to usernames and group
                       names on the current system.

      QUIT             Exit XTar.

      The Set Attributes pulldown menu allows you to set permissions,
      ownership, and, if you are root, the group id and time stamp, on
      extracted files.  To enable these options simply toggle the
      corresponding button.
